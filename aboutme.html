            Hello, my name is Christopher, but you can call me CJ. I have a
            strong passion for web designing and web development. I enjoy the
            process of building websites from the ground up, with a strong
            intent of doing my best. Each new website I create is always better
            than the last, only getting better with time. I feel that many
            websites are poorly developed, many don’t have any support for the
            disabled, or “too complex” design for the elderly. Websites should
            be a fast and smooth experience to get the information you need, not
            a maze to get to a small page. I offer a simple and easy process to
            make these simple, but well-designed websites.
          </h2>
        </td>
        <td>
          <h2 class="normaltext" style="color: #727272;">
            The building process would offer different layouts/designs for you
            to choose from. Themes are very important to a website and you would
            choose very wisely. Then there is the hardest part the development
            part. Coding with HTML and CSS feels very easy, simple, and has
            never held back any design I’ve had before. I offer many options and
            designs to give you the best simple website you could ever need.
